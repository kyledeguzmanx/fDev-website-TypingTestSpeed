# fDev-website-TypingTestSpeed   

## Introduction  
This is a simple web page to test your typing speed. The user is given a sentence to type. When the user begins to type, the timer begins. Once the user succesfully copies the sentence, the timer stops. If the user wants to reset the timer, they can also do that.

## Features  
- Text Box for Input  
- Timer  
- Restart Button  

## Technology  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Vanilla Javascript

## Improvements  
If I were to revisit this in the future, maybe I can randomize sentneces so the sentence will be different every time.
